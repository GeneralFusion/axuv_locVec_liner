This is a piece of work requested by Curtis to estimate the time 
an axuv beam will be blocked by the liner.
In this case presented, the location vector and liner trajectory used
is from M3V3.


read_axuv_yaml.py          read location vector yaml file and locate the edge of beam
liner_csv_time_loop.py     read JSD liner traj. and check the time for blocking of the beam
